# Project Name: Damped Pendulum Simulator

## Description
The Damped Pendulum Simulator is an interactive web application designed to simulate the behavior of a damped pendulum. Users can explore the dynamics of pendulum motion under the influence of damping, gravity, and rod length adjustments. This project provides a visual representation of how different parameters affect the oscillatory behavior of a pendulum, making it an educational tool for understanding classical mechanics concepts.

## Live Demo
[View Live Demo](https://himanshurw.github.io/pendulum_simulator/)

## Features
- Adjustable damping factor for simulating various levels of damping.
- Control over pendulum rod length to observe its impact on motion.
- Gravity adjustment to explore the effects of different gravitational strengths.
- Restart functionality to reset the pendulum for multiple trials.

## Usage
1. Open the live demo link in your web browser.
2. Adjust the sliders for damping factor, rod length, and gravity to modify parameters.
3. Click the "Restart" button to reset the pendulum to its initial state.
4. Observe the motion of the pendulum and analyze its behavior based on parameter changes.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the elements of the simulator.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for simulating pendulum motion.
- `README.md`: Markdown file containing project information and usage instructions.
